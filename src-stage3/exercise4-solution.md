# Exercise 4 Solution: CNN Implementation for Sokoban RL

## Code Path and Tensor Shape Breakdown

### 1. Entry Point (plots.ml:443)
```ocaml
Slide6_cnn.train_actor_critic_cnn env n_episodes lr_actor lr_critic gamma ~grid_size:10 ()
```

### 2. Network Initialization (slide6_cnn.ml:11-12)
- `initialize_cnn_policy ~grid_size:10 ()` → creates CNN with 3200 flattened features (32×10×10)
- `initialize_cnn_value ~grid_size:10 ()` → creates CNN with 3200 flattened features

### 3. Episode Collection (exercise4_cnn.ml:127-194)
- Environment reset: `[10, 10]` tensor (grid state)
- Reshape for CNN: `[1, 1, 10, 10]` (batch=1, channels=1, height=10, width=10)
- Network forward pass: `[1, 4]` logits (4 actions)
- Episode returns: states array of `[10, 10]` tensors

### 4. Batch Preparation (exercise4_cnn.ml:109-124)

```ocaml
prepare_states_batch_cnn: Array of [10, 10] → [batch_size, 1, 10, 10]
```

### 5. CNN Architecture (exercise4_cnn.ml:11-35)
```
Input: [batch, 1, 10, 10]
  ↓ Conv2d(1→16, 3×3)
Output: [batch, 16, 10, 10]  (Kaun maintains spatial dims)
  ↓ ReLU
  ↓ Conv2d(16→32, 3×3)
Output: [batch, 32, 10, 10]
  ↓ ReLU
  ↓ Flatten
Output: [batch, 3200]  (32 × 10 × 10)
  ↓ Linear(3200→64)
  ↓ ReLU
  ↓ Linear(64→4)
Output: [batch, 4]
```

### 6. Training Loop (slide6_cnn.ml:26-112)
- Collects episode with dynamic grid detection
- Prepares batch of states: `[n_actions, 1, 10, 10]`
- Value network forward: `[n_actions, 1]` → squeezed to `[n_actions]`
- Policy gradient computation with advantages
- Updates both networks with Adam optimizer

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **5D→4D Tensor Fix**: `prepare_states_batch_cnn` was reshaping to `[1, 1, H, W]` then stacking, creating 5D. Now reshapes to `[1, H, W]` for proper 4D output.

2. **Division by Zero**: Added `max 1` guard for episode storage frequency calculation.

3. **Dynamic Grid Size**: Networks adapt to environment's actual grid size (10×10 for verified-curriculum).

## Results

The benchmark now runs successfully, showing Actor-Critic CNN converging but with higher variance than the Backoff-Tabular baseline, which achieves better final performance (24.73 vs 0.00 average returns).
